This is my solution to the [Umoja3 Bounty](https://events.reach.sh/decentralized-umoja-3)

The Solution is a microblog called Mono Blog. It allows people to make blog post directly on the algorand blockchain network.
The live url can be found here [monoblog](https://mono-microblog.vercel.app/)

I made use of Next js, chakra UI and reach events to build this application. It's completely mobile responsive and works on all devices.
